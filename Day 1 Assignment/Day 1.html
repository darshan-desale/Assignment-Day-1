        Differential equation: 
An equation involving differential coefficient, dependant variable(s) and independent variable(s) is called 
Differential Equation.
Order of DE:
The order of differential equation is the order of highest derivative appearing in equation
Degree:
The degree of D E id degree of highest derivative appearing in DE when differential coefficient are free from radical 
and fractions.
Formation of Differential Equation:
Step 1: Find number of arbitrary constant in given solution
Step 2: Suppose number of arbitrary constant=n then differentiate solution n times
Step 3: eliminate the arbitrary constant from obtained equations. 
Note:
1) If solution is 𝑦 = 𝑐1 cos 𝑎𝑥 + 𝑐2 sin 𝑎𝑥 ,then Differential equation is of the
